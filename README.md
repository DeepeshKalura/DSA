> Engineering is not about the black box, it is about the white box.

# DSA-DEV
I always hate DSA, I don't know the reason why? But I always hate it. But love Development. Now, I just want to learn DSA as core subject for the development. A tool to remove the the blankness exited. I believe in live in general, humans looks for simple solutions simple solutions are not simple in this world. So, we end up with complex solutions. These complex solutions can only achieve by the appreciation of the simple solutions. So, here i am with the DSA-DEV.


## What is DSA-DEV?
It is just a simple solutions for me to learn and appreciate for the DSA, and learn engineering out of it. 

## Why DSA-DEV?
It is just a way to remove black box from my engineering life.

> SuccessFul Simple things lead to complex solutions. The person who appreciate simple and complex solutions understand the essence of engineering.


## How i will create white box?
- Simple learning a programming language it going to be C.
- Simple enhance my python learning or another modern learning.
> Reason for learning language in great detail, so my development experience will not depend on the google and looking up the solutions again and again.
- Simple learn one concept of DSA.
- Simple implement that concept in the python.
- Simple same thing i will implememnt in others i language which i need to learn like dart, rust, luna, etc. 
> The more you grow more language you need to learn and appreciate
- Simple now implement the same concept in the C.
- Then with the pratical example that concpet has been used which tool i must be using
- Then recreate the same part of the tool in anylangugae, i seem fit
- Then implement the same concept in the C.
- Then that concept become the samll project for me to learning new language, a framework, so whenever i need to learn a new way, how that new things improving from the c steps.
- Then these samll concpet which become chanllenging for me, while implementing now, it all become simple tesing and fun thing for me, to learn new tools and language.
- But the time learning new language and tools, become easy.
- New tools and language maybe come easy for you but it waste lot's of time.
- So, the simple solution is to build new concept and project methodology to learn.
- I will never care about fomo, framewrok, tools, person never be priority for me, just learning the new concepts.
- As, Software enginering and system enginering not more black box for you rather, simple white box and grey box which you can appreciate and learn.

## Why i start with python? 
- Becuase i already know python in great detail.
