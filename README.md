# DSA
learning optimization my study path to improve knowelege in DSA as well as Programming Language

### Structure of the code is:
Topic Folder -> Subtopic Folder -> Code File
code file name represents the topic and question number

# Step one 
Delete all the files 
Creating a folder structure with topic name
topic names are gnerally inspire by the leetcode topics tags
then there will be fundamental.py which will tell us about the core implementation of the data structure and algorithm

if there are more then one then we are going to create a subfolder which will cover all the topics
