## Searching Alogrithm 
Searching algorithm is a step by step process of finding a particular information from the given sets of data.

## Searching Terminology
In searching terminology there are Two important terms:
1. **Target Element**: The value which we are searching for. I call it `key`.
2. **Search Space**: The search space refers to the entire collection of data within which you are looking for the target element.

**Note**: The search space can be anything like an array, list, or any other data structure. It nature defines which searching algorithm is best suited for it.

## Types of Searching Alogrithm
1. **Linear Search**
2. **Binary Search**

Note: There are many other searching algorithms like Jump Search, Interpolation Search, Exponential Search, etc. But these are the most commonly used searching algorithms.
